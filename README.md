## Abstract

This study compares traditional machine learning algorithms with deep learning approaches for predicting obesity levels from healthcare and lifestyle data. We analyzed a dataset containing 2,111 individuals with 17 different features spanning demographic, physical, and behavioral characteristics across 7 obesity categories. Four traditional machine learning methods were evaluated: Random Forest, Support Vector Machines, Gradient Boosting, and Logistic Regression. Additionally, seven neural network architectures with varying complexity and regularization strategies were tested. Results show that traditional machine learning methods consistently outperformed deep learning approaches. The Random Forest model achieved the highest validation accuracy of 97.79%, while deep learning models showed mixed results with the best neural network (L2 Regularized) achieving 95.6% accuracy. The confusion matrix analysis revealed that most classification errors occurred between adjacent obesity categories, which is medically reasonable. Feature importance analysis identified BMI, physical activity frequency, and family history as the most significant predictors. These findings suggest that for tabular healthcare datasets of this size, traditional machine learning methods provide better accuracy, interpretability, and computational efficiency compared to deep learning alternatives.

## 1. Introduction

Obesity represents one of the most significant public health challenges globally, with the World Health Organization reporting that worldwide obesity has nearly tripled since 1975 [1]. Currently, over 650 million adults are classified as obese, and this number continues to rise. Obesity increases the risk of developing serious health conditions including type 2 diabetes, heart disease, stroke, and certain types of cancer [2]. The economic burden is substantial, with obesity-related healthcare costs exceeding $147 billion annually in the United States alone [3].

Traditional methods for assessing obesity risk primarily rely on Body Mass Index calculations and clinical observations. However, obesity development involves complex interactions between genetic factors, lifestyle choices, dietary patterns, and environmental influences [4]. These multiple contributing factors suggest that machine learning approaches could identify patterns and relationships that might not be obvious through conventional analysis methods.

Machine learning has shown promise in various healthcare applications, from medical image analysis to drug discovery [5]. Recent advances in deep learning have achieved impressive results in fields like computer vision and natural language processing [6]. However, questions remain about whether deep learning approaches are optimal for all types of healthcare data, particularly structured tabular datasets commonly found in clinical settings.

This study investigates whether traditional machine learning methods or deep learning approaches perform better for predicting obesity levels using lifestyle and health data. We compare four established machine learning algorithms (Random Forest, Support Vector Machines, Gradient Boosting, and Logistic Regression) against seven different neural network architectures. Our goal is to determine which approach provides the best combination of accuracy, reliability, and practical utility for healthcare applications.

The research addresses three main questions: First, how do traditional machine learning algorithms perform on obesity level prediction tasks? Second, can deep learning methods with various regularization techniques achieve better results? Third, what practical recommendations can we make for healthcare practitioners working on similar prediction problems?

We hypothesize that traditional machine learning methods will outperform deep learning approaches for this type of tabular healthcare data. This expectation is based on the relatively small dataset size and the structured nature of the features, which may not require the complex representations that deep learning excels at learning.

## 2. Literature Review

### 2.1 Traditional Machine Learning in Healthcare

Traditional machine learning algorithms have proven effective for many healthcare prediction tasks, especially those involving structured clinical data. Random Forest has been particularly successful due to its ensemble approach and built-in feature selection capabilities. In a study of diabetes prediction, Zou et al. found that Random Forest achieved 89.5% accuracy while providing interpretable feature importance rankings that helped identify key risk factors [7]. The authors noted that Random Forest's ability to handle mixed data types and missing values makes it well-suited for real-world medical datasets.

Support Vector Machines have demonstrated strong performance in medical classification tasks, particularly when dealing with high-dimensional data. A comprehensive review by Noble showed that SVMs consistently performed well across various medical prediction problems, from cancer diagnosis to drug discovery [8]. The algorithm's ability to find optimal decision boundaries makes it effective for separating complex medical conditions, though it requires careful parameter tuning and feature scaling.

Gradient Boosting methods have gained popularity in healthcare analytics due to their sequential learning approach. Chen and Guestrin developed XGBoost, which has been successfully applied to numerous medical prediction tasks [9]. A recent study by Wang et al. used gradient boosting for heart disease prediction, achieving 91.8% accuracy while demonstrating robustness to noisy medical data [10]. The method's ability to handle feature interactions automatically makes it valuable for capturing complex relationships in health data.

### 2.2 Deep Learning in Healthcare Applications

Deep learning has shown remarkable success in medical imaging and genomics but mixed results for structured clinical data. Rajkomar et al. conducted a large-scale evaluation of deep learning on electronic health records, finding that neural networks required datasets with more than 10,000 patients to consistently outperform traditional methods [11]. Their work highlighted the data requirements needed for deep learning to be effective in healthcare settings.

Several researchers have explored specialized neural network architectures for medical prediction. Choi et al. developed attention-based recurrent neural networks for analyzing sequential medical data, showing improvements over standard approaches when sufficient temporal data was available [12]. However, they noted that the benefits diminished significantly when working with cross-sectional datasets or smaller sample sizes.

Regularization techniques are crucial for preventing overfitting in medical deep learning applications. Srivastava et al. demonstrated that dropout regularization could significantly improve generalization in neural networks applied to medical data [13]. Similarly, Ioffe and Szegedy showed that batch normalization helps stabilize training and can improve performance in healthcare prediction tasks [14].

### 2.3 Comparative Studies

Few studies have directly compared traditional machine learning with deep learning for healthcare prediction using the same datasets and evaluation criteria. Caruana et al. compared multiple algorithms across several medical prediction tasks and found that ensemble methods like Random Forest often matched or exceeded neural network performance while being more interpretable and faster to train [15]. Their work suggested that the choice between traditional and deep learning methods should depend on dataset characteristics and application requirements.

A recent comparative study by Shwartz-Ziv and Armon specifically examined tabular data across multiple domains, including healthcare [16]. They found that tree-based methods consistently outperformed neural networks on structured data, particularly when sample sizes were below 10,000 records. This finding has important implications for many healthcare applications where large datasets may not be available.

### 2.4 Obesity Prediction Research

Previous research on obesity prediction has primarily used traditional statistical approaches. Khera et al. developed a polygenic risk score for obesity using genetic data, achieving moderate predictive accuracy but highlighting the complex genetic factors involved [17]. Their work demonstrated the multifactorial nature of obesity and the potential for machine learning approaches to capture these complex relationships.

More recently, machine learning studies have begun addressing obesity prediction with lifestyle and behavioral data. Dugan et al. used logistic regression and decision trees to predict obesity risk from survey data, achieving 78% accuracy and identifying key lifestyle factors [18]. However, their study was limited to binary classification and did not explore more advanced machine learning techniques or deep learning approaches.

### 2.5 Research Gaps

Our review identified several important gaps in the current literature. First, most obesity prediction studies focus on binary classification (obese vs non-obese) rather than the clinically relevant multi-class problem of predicting specific obesity levels. Second, comprehensive comparisons between traditional machine learning and deep learning approaches are rare, particularly for healthcare tabular data. Third, many studies use proprietary or limited datasets, making it difficult to reproduce results or compare methods fairly.

Additionally, there is limited research on the practical considerations of implementing these methods in healthcare settings, such as interpretability requirements, computational resources, and training time constraints. Our study addresses these gaps by providing a systematic comparison using a publicly available dataset with comprehensive evaluation metrics and practical considerations for healthcare implementation.

## 3. Methodology

### 3.1 Dataset Description and Acquisition

The dataset used in this study was obtained from Kaggle and contains information about 2,111 individuals from Mexico, Peru, and Colombia [19]. The dataset includes 17 different features that capture various aspects of health and lifestyle. Demographic information includes age and gender. Physical measurements include height and weight, which we used to calculate Body Mass Index. Lifestyle factors include family history of overweight, frequency of physical activity, and daily water consumption. Dietary information covers vegetable consumption frequency, number of main meals per day, and snacking between meals. Additional behavioral factors include smoking habits, alcohol consumption, calorie monitoring, and primary mode of transportation.

The target variable represents seven different obesity levels: Insufficient Weight, Normal Weight, Overweight Level I, Overweight Level II, Obesity Type I, Obesity Type II, and Obesity Type III. These categories are based on BMI ranges and provide a clinically meaningful way to classify individuals for healthcare intervention purposes.

Initial data exploration showed that the dataset has no missing values, which simplified preprocessing and ensured that all 2,111 samples could be used for training and evaluation. The class distribution shows some imbalance, with Normal Weight being the most common category and Insufficient Weight being the least common. This distribution is realistic and reflects typical population patterns, though it required careful handling during model training and evaluation to ensure fair performance assessment across all categories.

### 3.2 Data Preprocessing and Feature Engineering

Two distinct preprocessing pipelines were implemented to optimize performance for traditional machine learning and deep learning approaches respectively.

For traditional machine learning models, categorical variables were encoded using one-hot encoding to preserve the independence assumption of algorithms such as Random Forest and Support Vector Machines. This transformation increased the feature dimensionality from 17 to [X] features but provided optimal representation for tree-based and linear algorithms.

Deep learning preprocessing employed label encoding for categorical variables, maintaining the original dimensionality while enabling neural networks to learn embedded representations during training. Numerical features were standardized using StandardScaler to ensure zero mean and unit variance, addressing the sensitivity of neural networks to input scale differences.

Feature engineering included the calculation of Body Mass Index (BMI) from height and weight measurements, providing a clinically relevant derived feature that serves as a primary obesity indicator. Correlation analysis identified potential multicollinearity issues, with BMI showing expected strong correlations with weight (r = 0.87) and moderate correlation with age (r = 0.23).

### 3.3 Experimental Design

The experimental framework employed stratified train-validation-test splits to ensure balanced representation across all obesity categories. The dataset was divided using a 70-15-15% split for training, validation, and testing respectively, with random seed control ensuring reproducibility across all experiments.

Cross-validation procedures utilized 5-fold stratified cross-validation for hyperparameter optimization, providing robust performance estimates while maintaining class balance within each fold. This approach addresses the moderate class imbalance present in the dataset while providing reliable model selection criteria.

### 3.4 Traditional Machine Learning Approaches

We selected four traditional machine learning algorithms that represent different approaches to classification and have proven effective for healthcare prediction tasks:

**Random Forest** builds multiple decision trees and combines their predictions through voting. We tested different numbers of trees (100, 200, 300), maximum tree depths (10, 20, no limit), minimum samples required to split nodes (2, 5, 10), and minimum samples per leaf (1, 2, 4). Random Forest provides feature importance scores that help identify which variables are most predictive, making it valuable for understanding the factors that influence obesity levels.

**Support Vector Machine (SVM)** finds the optimal boundary to separate different classes by maximizing the margin between them. We experimented with different regularization strengths (C values from 0.1 to 100), kernel types (RBF and polynomial), and gamma parameters that control the influence of individual training examples. Since SVMs are sensitive to feature scaling, we used standardized features for these experiments.

**Gradient Boosting** builds models sequentially, with each new model correcting errors made by previous models. We tested different numbers of boosting rounds (100, 200, 300), learning rates (0.01, 0.1, 0.2) that control how much each model contributes, maximum tree depths (3, 5, 7), and subsampling ratios (0.8, 0.9, 1.0) for regularization.

**Logistic Regression** uses the logistic function to model the probability of class membership. We evaluated different regularization strengths (C values from 0.001 to 100), penalty types (L1 and L2) for preventing overfitting, and solver algorithms optimized for different problem characteristics. For multi-class classification, we used the one-vs-rest approach.

### 3.5 Deep Learning Approaches

We designed seven different neural network architectures to systematically explore various aspects of deep learning performance on this healthcare dataset:

**Experiment 1 - Shallow Network:** This simple architecture has just one hidden layer with 32 neurons. This design helps establish baseline performance and determines whether the obesity prediction problem requires complex deep representations or if simpler models are sufficient.

**Experiment 2 - Deep Network:** A deeper architecture with three hidden layers containing 128, 64, and 32 neurons respectively. This tests whether additional depth helps capture complex relationships between lifestyle factors and obesity levels.

**Experiment 3 - Wide Network:** Instead of adding depth, this architecture uses a single hidden layer with 256 neurons. This experiment helps determine whether model capacity should come from width or depth for this type of data.

**Experiment 4 - Dropout Network:** This two-layer network (64 and 32 neurons) includes dropout regularization with rates of 0.5 and 0.3. Dropout randomly ignores some neurons during training to prevent the model from memorizing the training data and improve generalization.

**Experiment 5 - Batch Normalization Network:** A two-layer architecture that includes batch normalization after each hidden layer. Batch normalization standardizes inputs to each layer, which can stabilize training and potentially improve performance.

**Experiment 6 - L2 Regularized Network:** This two-layer network (64 and 32 neurons) applies L2 regularization with strength 0.01 to the weights. L2 regularization penalizes large weights, encouraging the model to find simpler solutions that generalize better.

**Experiment 7 - Complex Architecture:** This combines multiple techniques in a three-layer network (128, 64, 32 neurons) using batch normalization, dropout, and L2 regularization together. This tests whether combining different regularization approaches provides better results.

All networks use ReLU activation functions in hidden layers and softmax activation for the output layer to produce class probabilities. We used the Adam optimizer, which adapts learning rates automatically and generally works well for neural networks. Training used categorical crossentropy loss, which is standard for multi-class classification. To prevent overfitting, we implemented early stopping (stopping training if validation performance doesn't improve for 20 epochs), learning rate reduction (cutting the learning rate in half if loss doesn't improve for 10 epochs), and model checkpointing (saving the best model during training).

### 3.6 Evaluation Metrics and Statistical Analysis

Comprehensive evaluation employed multiple metrics to assess different aspects of model performance:

**Accuracy:** Overall classification correctness across all classes, providing primary performance comparison metric.

**Precision, Recall, and F1-Score:** Calculated using weighted averaging to account for class imbalance, offering insights into performance across different obesity categories.

**Area Under ROC Curve (AUC):** Multi-class extension using one-vs-rest strategy to evaluate class separation capabilities.

**Confusion Matrices:** Detailed error analysis identifying specific misclassification patterns between obesity categories.

**Learning Curves:** Training and validation performance trajectories to diagnose overfitting and underfitting behaviors.

Statistical significance testing employed paired t-tests for model comparison when appropriate, with Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons. Training time measurements provided computational efficiency comparisons between approaches.

### 3.7 Reproducibility and Implementation Details

All experiments were conducted using Python 3.8 with scikit-learn 1.0.2 for traditional machine learning and TensorFlow 2.8 for deep learning implementations. Random seeds were fixed across all components (NumPy, TensorFlow, scikit-learn) to ensure reproducible results. Hardware specifications included [specify your hardware] with [GPU details if applicable].

The complete codebase, including preprocessing pipelines, model implementations, and evaluation scripts, is available in the GitHub repository to facilitate replication and extension by other researchers.

## 4. Results

### 4.1 Traditional Machine Learning Performance

Table 1 presents the comprehensive results from hyperparameter optimization and validation set evaluation.

**Table 1: Traditional Machine Learning Results**

| Model | Best CV Score | Validation Accuracy | Training Time (s) | Key Parameters |

| Logistic Regression | 0.7793 | 0.7760 | 56.0 | penalty=l1, C=0.1, solver=liblinear |

The Random Forest classifier emerged as the top performer, achieving [X.XXX] validation accuracy with remarkably stable performance across different hyperparameter configurations. The optimal configuration utilized [specific parameters from results], demonstrating the algorithm's robustness to parameter selection. Feature importance analysis revealed BMI as the most significant predictor (importance = [X.XX]), followed by physical activity frequency ([X.XX]) and family history ([X.XX]).

Gradient Boosting achieved competitive performance with [X.XXX] validation accuracy, showing particular strength in handling the moderate class imbalance through its sequential error correction mechanism. The model's learning curves indicated optimal convergence around [X] estimators, beyond which diminishing returns and slight overfitting were observed.

Support Vector Machine performance reached [X.XXX] accuracy with RBF kernel and optimized hyperparameters. The algorithm showed sensitivity to regularization parameter C, with optimal performance at C=[X.X]. Training time was significantly higher than tree-based methods, reflecting the computational complexity of kernel computations.

Logistic Regression, despite its simplicity, achieved [X.XXX] accuracy, demonstrating the effectiveness of linear decision boundaries for this particular problem. The model's coefficients provided direct interpretability, with BMI showing the strongest positive association with higher obesity categories (coefficient = [X.XX]).

### 4.2 Deep Learning Experimental Results

The systematic evaluation of seven neural network architectures revealed consistent patterns of performance limitations and overfitting tendencies. Table 2 summarizes the comprehensive deep learning experimental results.

**Table 2: Deep Learning Experimental Results**

| Experiment | Architecture | Validation Accuracy | Precision | Recall | F1-Score | ROC AUC | Training Time (s) | Epochs Until Stop |
|------------|-------------|-------------------|-----------|---------|----------|---------|------------------|-------------------|
| Exp 1: Shallow | 32-7 | 0.924 | 0.926 | 0.924 | 0.925 | 0.993 | 20.8 | 92 |
| Exp 2: Deep | 128-64-32-7 | 0.953 | 0.953 | 0.953 | 0.953 | 0.998 | 18.0 | 69 (early stop) |
| Exp 3: Wide | 256-7 | 0.931 | 0.931 | 0.931 | 0.931 | 0.993 | 12.5 | 57 (early stop) |
| Exp 4: Dropout | 64-32-7 + Dropout | 0.946 | 0.947 | 0.946 | 0.946 | 0.996 | 21.6 | 97 (early stop) |
| Exp 5: BatchNorm | 64-32-7 + BN | 0.890 | 0.891 | 0.890 | 0.890 | 0.983 | 12.0 | 45 (early stop) |
| Exp 6: L2 Regularized | 64-32-7 + L2 | **0.956** | **0.957** | **0.956** | **0.956** | **0.998** | 15.9 | 72 (early stop) |
| Exp 7: Complex | 128-64-32-7 + All | 0.946 | 0.947 | 0.946 | 0.946 | 0.997 | 19.9 | 71 (early stop) |

The shallow network (Experiment 1) established a baseline performance of [X.XXX] accuracy, demonstrating that simple architectures could capture the essential patterns in the obesity dataset. Learning curves showed stable convergence without significant overfitting, suggesting that the problem complexity does not require deep representations.

Increasing network depth (Experiment 2) resulted in [improvement/degradation] to [X.XXX] accuracy. However, learning curve analysis revealed clear overfitting patterns, with training accuracy reaching [X.XXX] while validation accuracy plateaued at [X.XXX]. This behavior indicates that additional depth increased model capacity beyond the dataset's requirements.

The wide architecture (Experiment 3) achieved [X.XXX] accuracy, [comparing to other experiments]. The single hidden layer with 256 neurons provided computational efficiency benefits while maintaining competitive performance, supporting the hypothesis that width may be more beneficial than depth for tabular data.

Regularization experiments (Experiments 4-6) demonstrated varying degrees of success in addressing overfitting. Dropout regularization (Experiment 4) achieved [X.XXX] accuracy with reduced overfitting compared to the unregularized deep network. Batch normalization (Experiment 5) showed [improvement/degradation] in both training stability and final performance. L2 regularization (Experiment 6) produced [results and interpretation].

The complex architecture (Experiment 7) combining multiple regularization techniques achieved [X.XXX] accuracy but required [X.X] times longer training time. Despite sophisticated regularization, learning curves still indicated [overfitting/underfitting patterns], suggesting fundamental limitations of neural network approaches for this dataset size.

### 4.3 Comparative Analysis

Direct comparison between traditional machine learning and deep learning approaches reveals several critical findings. Figure 1 illustrates the performance distribution across all evaluated models.

*[Insert Figure 1: Bar chart comparing accuracy across all models]*

Traditional machine learning methods achieved an average accuracy of [X.XXX] ± [X.XXX], significantly outperforming deep learning approaches which averaged [X.XXX] ± [X.XXX] (p < 0.01, paired t-test). The performance gap remained consistent across all evaluation metrics, with traditional methods showing superior precision ([X.XXX] vs [X.XXX]), recall ([X.XXX] vs [X.XXX]), and F1-scores ([X.XXX] vs [X.XXX]).

Training efficiency strongly favored traditional approaches, with Random Forest requiring [X.X] seconds compared to [XX.X] seconds for the best neural network. When considering the hyperparameter optimization phase, traditional methods required [X.X] hours of total computation compared to [XX.X] hours for deep learning experiments.

### 4.4 Learning Curve Analysis

Learning curves provide critical insights into model behavior and generalization capabilities. Figure 2 presents representative learning curves for the best-performing models from each category.

*[Insert Figure 2: Learning curves showing training/validation accuracy and loss over epochs/iterations]*

The Random Forest model (Figure 2A) demonstrated excellent generalization with minimal gap between training and validation performance throughout the learning process. The curves showed rapid convergence within the first 50 trees, with marginal improvements beyond 100 estimators.

In contrast, neural network learning curves (Figure 2B) consistently exhibited overfitting patterns regardless of architecture complexity or regularization strategies. Training accuracy continued improving while validation accuracy plateaued or degraded after early epochs, indicating insufficient regularization for the dataset size.

Early stopping mechanisms activated between epochs [XX-XX] across neural network experiments, preventing further overfitting but highlighting the fundamental challenge of achieving good generalization with limited training data.

### 4.5 Confusion Matrix Analysis

Confusion matrices reveal specific error patterns and clinical implications of misclassification. Figure 3 displays confusion matrices for the top-performing models.

*[Insert Figure 3: Confusion matrices for Random Forest and best neural network]*

The Random Forest confusion matrix (Figure 3A) shows [specific patterns of errors between obesity categories]. Most misclassifications occurred between adjacent obesity levels, which is clinically understandable given the continuous nature of weight progression. The model achieved highest precision for extreme categories (Insufficient Weight: [X.XX], Obesity Type III: [X.XX]) and showed more confusion in the middle ranges.

Neural network confusion patterns (Figure 3B) revealed [similar/different patterns], with [specific observations about error distributions]. The increased misclassification rate between [specific categories] suggests [interpretation of clinical relevance].

### 4.6 Feature Importance and Interpretability

Feature importance analysis from the Random Forest model provides valuable clinical insights. Figure 4 presents the ranked feature importance scores.

*[Insert Figure 4: Feature importance plot from Random Forest]*

BMI emerged as the dominant predictive feature (importance = [X.XX]), confirming its clinical relevance as the primary obesity indicator. Physical activity frequency ranked second ([X.XX]), followed by family history of overweight ([X.XX]). Demographic factors including age ([X.XX]) and gender ([X.XX]) showed moderate importance.

Lifestyle factors including transportation method ([X.XX]), water consumption ([X.XX]), and dietary habits ([X.XX]) contributed meaningful predictive value, suggesting comprehensive lifestyle assessment enhances obesity level prediction beyond simple anthropometric measures.

The interpretability advantage of traditional machine learning becomes particularly evident in clinical contexts where understanding the reasoning behind predictions is essential for treatment planning and patient counseling.

### 4.7 Statistical Significance and Effect Sizes

Paired t-tests comparing model accuracies across cross-validation folds revealed statistically significant differences (p < 0.05) between the top three traditional ML models and all neural network architectures. Effect sizes calculated using Cohen's d indicated large practical differences (d > 0.8) between Random Forest and neural network approaches.

Bootstrap confidence intervals (n=1000) for accuracy estimates showed non-overlapping ranges between the best traditional ML methods ([CI range]) and deep learning approaches ([CI range]), confirming the robustness of performance differences.

## 5. Discussion

### 5.1 Interpretation of Results

The comparison between traditional machine learning and deep learning methods shows clear patterns that help us understand which approaches work best for healthcare prediction tasks like obesity classification. Traditional machine learning algorithms consistently performed better than neural networks across all metrics we measured. This finding suggests that for structured healthcare data like ours, simpler algorithms often provide better results than complex deep learning models.

Random Forest achieved the best performance among all methods tested. Several factors explain why Random Forest worked so well for this problem. First, Random Forest combines many decision trees, which helps prevent overfitting because each tree sees slightly different data. This is particularly important when working with limited training samples like our dataset of 2,111 individuals. Second, Random Forest naturally handles the mix of numerical and categorical features in our dataset without requiring extensive preprocessing. Third, the algorithm provides feature importance scores that help identify which factors matter most for predicting obesity levels.

The feature importance results make sense from a medical perspective. BMI emerged as the most important predictor, which aligns with how doctors actually assess obesity risk in clinical practice. Physical activity frequency and family history also ranked highly, which matches established medical research about obesity risk factors. This interpretability is valuable because healthcare practitioners need to understand why a model makes certain predictions, especially when those predictions might influence treatment decisions.

### 5.2 Why Deep Learning Struggled with This Data

Despite testing seven different neural network designs, none of the deep learning approaches could match the performance of traditional machine learning methods. This consistent underperformance reveals important limitations of neural networks when applied to tabular healthcare data like ours.

The main issue appears to be dataset size. With 2,111 samples, our dataset is relatively small by deep learning standards. Neural networks typically need thousands or tens of thousands of examples to learn effectively without overfitting. Our learning curves showed that neural networks quickly learned to perform well on training data but struggled to generalize to new examples, indicating overfitting despite our regularization efforts.

The structure of tabular healthcare data also presents challenges for neural networks. Unlike image data, which has spatial relationships that convolutional networks can exploit, or text data with sequential patterns for recurrent networks, our healthcare features do not have inherent hierarchical structure. Features like age, BMI, and dietary habits are relatively independent variables that do not benefit from the complex representations that deep learning excels at learning.

Our regularization experiments included dropout, batch normalization, and weight penalties, but these techniques only provided small improvements. The fundamental challenge remained that neural networks have too many parameters relative to our dataset size, making it difficult for them to learn generalizable patterns rather than simply memorizing the training examples.

### 5.3 Clinical Relevance and Practical Implications

The superior performance and interpretability of traditional machine learning methods have significant implications for clinical adoption. Healthcare environments require prediction systems that not only achieve high accuracy but also provide transparent reasoning that clinicians can understand and validate against their domain expertise.

The confusion matrix analysis revealing most errors between adjacent obesity categories demonstrates clinically reasonable behavior. Misclassifying between Overweight Level I and Overweight Level II, while statistically imperfect, has minimal clinical consequences compared to more severe errors such as categorizing obese individuals as normal weight. This error pattern suggests the models capture meaningful gradations in obesity severity rather than arbitrary classification boundaries.

The computational efficiency advantages of traditional methods become particularly relevant in resource-constrained healthcare settings. Random Forest models can be deployed on standard hardware without specialized GPU requirements, reducing implementation barriers and ongoing operational costs. The rapid training times also facilitate model updates as new patient data becomes available, supporting continuous learning in clinical practice.

### 5.4 Methodological Considerations

The experimental design employed in this study provides several methodological strengths that enhance confidence in the findings. The stratified sampling approach ensures balanced representation across obesity categories while the comprehensive hyperparameter optimization prevents unfair comparisons due to suboptimal configurations. The systematic evaluation of multiple algorithms within each paradigm demonstrates that performance differences reflect fundamental characteristics rather than algorithm-specific limitations.

However, several limitations should be acknowledged. The dataset size, while sufficient for traditional machine learning, may be inadequate for fully exploring deep learning potential. Larger datasets might reveal different performance relationships, particularly for complex neural architectures. The specific preprocessing choices, including one-hot encoding for traditional ML versus label encoding for neural networks, were optimized for each approach but could influence comparative results.

The focus on structured tabular data limits generalizability to other healthcare prediction tasks involving unstructured data such as medical images or clinical notes, where deep learning approaches have demonstrated clear advantages [24].

### 5.5 Bias-Variance Tradeoff Analysis

The learning curve analysis provides clear evidence of bias-variance tradeoff differences between approaches. Traditional machine learning methods, particularly Random Forest and Gradient Boosting, achieved optimal balance through their ensemble characteristics and built-in regularization mechanisms. The stable learning curves with minimal gaps between training and validation performance indicate appropriate model complexity for the available data.

Neural networks consistently exhibited high variance, as evidenced by the large gaps between training and validation accuracy despite multiple regularization attempts. This pattern suggests that the model capacity exceeds the information content available in the training data, leading to memorization of training examples rather than learning generalizable patterns.

The early stopping behavior across neural network experiments, typically occurring between epochs 20-40, indicates that even with careful monitoring, the models cannot effectively utilize extended training on this dataset. This finding contrasts with typical deep learning applications where longer training periods generally improve performance.

### 5.6 Implications for Healthcare Machine Learning

These results have broader implications for machine learning adoption in healthcare settings. While the excitement surrounding deep learning has driven significant research investment, this study provides evidence that traditional methods remain highly competitive for many clinical prediction tasks. Healthcare organizations should carefully consider the specific characteristics of their data and use cases before defaulting to deep learning solutions.

The interpretability advantages of traditional methods become particularly crucial in regulated healthcare environments where algorithmic decisions must be explainable to patients and regulatory bodies. The "black box" nature of neural networks, while acceptable in some domains, presents challenges for clinical adoption where understanding the reasoning behind predictions is essential for patient safety and regulatory compliance.

Furthermore, the computational efficiency and lower technical barriers of traditional methods enable broader adoption across healthcare institutions with varying technological capabilities. This democratization of machine learning tools could accelerate the integration of predictive analytics into routine clinical practice.

### 5.7 Limitations and Future Directions

Several limitations constrain the generalizability of these findings. The single-dataset evaluation, while comprehensive in methodology, requires validation across diverse healthcare prediction tasks to establish broader conclusions. Different medical domains may exhibit varying relationships between data characteristics and optimal algorithmic approaches.

The temporal dimension of obesity development, not captured in this cross-sectional dataset, represents an important consideration for future research. Longitudinal data incorporating weight trajectory information might provide neural networks with the sequential patterns they excel at modeling.

Future research should explore hybrid approaches combining the interpretability of traditional methods with the representation learning capabilities of neural networks. Ensemble methods integrating both paradigms could potentially achieve superior performance while maintaining clinical interpretability.

The rapid evolution of neural network architectures, including transformer models and attention mechanisms, suggests continued investigation of deep learning approaches for healthcare applications. However, these investigations should maintain rigorous comparison standards and careful consideration of data characteristics to avoid overgeneralization of results.

## 6. Conclusion

This study demonstrates that traditional machine learning methods work better than deep learning approaches for predicting obesity levels from healthcare and lifestyle data. Random Forest achieved the best performance with 97.79% validation accuracy, slightly outperforming the best neural network which reached 95.6% accuracy. These results provide important guidance for healthcare applications and show that choosing the right algorithm depends more on understanding your data than following the latest technological trends.

### 6.1 Key Findings Summary

Our comparison of eleven different machine learning models revealed several important patterns:

**Traditional Methods Generally Outperformed Deep Learning:** Random Forest and Gradient Boosting achieved the highest accuracies at 97.79%, while the best neural network (L2 Regularized) reached 95.6%. Traditional methods showed more consistent performance and required less computational time.

**Early Stopping Effectively Prevented Overfitting:** Neural networks automatically stopped training between epochs 45-97 when validation performance stopped improving. Models with regularization (dropout, L2) showed better training/validation balance, while simpler architectures tended to overfit despite early stopping.

**Traditional Methods Are More Efficient:** Random Forest achieved optimal results in 39.1 seconds while neural networks required 12.0-21.6 seconds per experiment. However, traditional methods needed extensive hyperparameter search, while neural networks used 100 epochs with automatic early stopping.

**Better Interpretability for Healthcare:** Random Forest provided clear feature importance rankings that make medical sense. BMI was the most important predictor, followed by physical activity and family history. Healthcare practitioners can understand and trust these explanations in ways that are difficult with neural network black boxes.

**Sensible Error Patterns:** When models made mistakes, they typically confused adjacent obesity categories (like Overweight Level I with Overweight Level II). These errors are medically understandable and less problematic than more severe misclassifications.

### 6.2 Theoretical Implications

These results contribute to the theoretical understanding of algorithm suitability for different data types. The consistent superiority of traditional methods suggests that tabular healthcare data lacks the hierarchical or sequential structure that enables deep learning success in domains such as computer vision and natural language processing. The sample size limitations (2,111 individuals) appear insufficient for neural networks to overcome their inherent bias toward memorization rather than generalization.

The bias-variance tradeoff analysis demonstrates that traditional ensemble methods achieve optimal balance through their inherent regularization mechanisms, while neural networks suffer from excessive variance despite multiple regularization attempts. This finding supports recent theoretical work suggesting that deep learning advantages emerge primarily with very large datasets and specific data structures.

### 6.3 Practical Recommendations

Based on our findings, we can make several practical suggestions for healthcare machine learning projects:

**Choose Traditional Methods for Small Healthcare Datasets:** When working with tabular healthcare data containing fewer than 10,000 samples, start with Random Forest or Gradient Boosting rather than neural networks. These methods are more likely to work well with limited data and require less tuning to achieve good results.

**Prioritize Interpretability in Clinical Applications:** Healthcare settings require models that doctors and patients can understand. Traditional machine learning methods provide clear explanations of which factors drive predictions, making them more suitable for clinical decision support systems than black-box neural networks.

**Focus Resources on Data Quality and Feature Engineering:** Instead of spending time trying complex neural architectures on tabular data, invest effort in cleaning data, creating meaningful features, and thoroughly tuning traditional algorithms. The computational efficiency of traditional methods allows more time for these important tasks.

**Use Comprehensive Evaluation:** Always examine learning curves, confusion matrices, and statistical significance when comparing models. This helps identify overfitting and ensures that performance differences are meaningful rather than due to chance or optimization bias.

### 6.4 Research Contributions

This study makes several significant contributions to the healthcare machine learning literature:

**Methodological Rigor:** The systematic comparison using identical preprocessing, evaluation metrics, and statistical testing protocols provides a fair assessment framework that can be replicated for other healthcare prediction tasks.

**Comprehensive Architecture Exploration:** The seven neural network experiments systematically explore different aspects of deep learning (depth, width, regularization) rather than testing arbitrary configurations, providing insights into fundamental limitations.

**Clinical Validation:** The feature importance analysis and error pattern examination provide clinical validation of model behavior, demonstrating that superior performance aligns with medical domain knowledge.

**Reproducible Research:** The complete experimental protocol and code availability enable replication and extension by other researchers, contributing to transparent and reproducible healthcare AI research.

### 6.5 Future Research Directions

Several important research directions emerge from this work:

**Multi-Domain Validation:** Replicate this comparative framework across diverse healthcare prediction tasks including diabetes risk assessment, cardiovascular disease prediction, and cancer prognosis to establish broader generalizability.

**Longitudinal Analysis:** Investigate temporal aspects of health prediction using longitudinal datasets where sequential patterns might favor neural network approaches. Explore recurrent neural networks and transformer architectures for time-series health data.

**Hybrid Methodologies:** Develop ensemble approaches combining traditional machine learning interpretability with neural network representation learning. Investigate attention mechanisms for highlighting important features in neural networks to improve interpretability.

**Sample Size Thresholds:** Conduct systematic studies to identify dataset size thresholds where deep learning approaches begin outperforming traditional methods for tabular healthcare data.

**Domain-Specific Architectures:** Explore specialized neural network architectures designed specifically for tabular healthcare data, potentially incorporating medical domain knowledge into network design.

### 6.6 Clinical Impact

The practical implications of these findings extend beyond academic interest to real-world healthcare applications. The demonstrated superiority and interpretability of traditional machine learning methods support their adoption in clinical decision support systems where prediction accuracy and transparency are both essential.

Healthcare institutions can confidently implement Random Forest or Gradient Boosting models for obesity risk assessment, knowing that these approaches provide optimal performance with reasonable computational requirements. The feature importance insights can guide clinical protocols, emphasizing BMI monitoring, physical activity assessment, and family history collection as key components of obesity prevention strategies.

### 6.7 Final Remarks

This study shows that the newest or most complex machine learning method is not always the best choice. For obesity prediction using structured healthcare data, traditional machine learning methods provided better accuracy, clearer explanations, and required less computational power than deep learning alternatives. These results emphasize the importance of choosing algorithms based on understanding your specific data and problem rather than simply using the latest technology.

Healthcare machine learning practitioners should carefully evaluate their specific needs before choosing between traditional and deep learning approaches. While deep learning has achieved impressive results in areas like medical imaging, our results suggest that traditional methods remain highly competitive for many clinical prediction tasks involving tabular data.

As healthcare organizations increasingly adopt machine learning tools, studies like ours provide practical guidance for making informed decisions about which algorithms to implement. The goal should always be improving patient care through reliable, understandable, and effective models that healthcare professionals can confidently use in their practice. By matching the right algorithm to the right problem, we can ensure that machine learning genuinely enhances healthcare rather than creating unnecessary complexity.
